These farmers face significant challenges: maintaining production levels without expanding agricultural land, decoupling crops from deforestation, and addressing climate change impacts such as water scarcity, extreme weather events, and pest and diseases proliferation.\n\nFarmers use diverse agroecological management practices to maintain their production levels. \n\n**But how efficient are these practices?** \n\n\\\n\\\n\n::::{.cr-section layout=\"sidebar-left\"}\n\n:::{#cr-fig_1}\n\n![](./pics/map_1.png){width=85%}\n\n:::\n\nIn 2023, we conducted a study in [**Ucayali**]{style=\"color:#a7c957;\"} (Provinces of Padre Abad and Coronel Portillo), the third largest cacao-producing region in Peru. @cr-fig_1\n\nThe study uses the [\"Agroecological practices characterization survey\"](https://hdl.handle.net/10568/139817) of the [CGIAR Initiative on Agroecology](https://www.cgiar.org/initiative/agroecology/) to assess the efficiency of agroecological practices of cacao producers, in terms of resource use and output production. @cr-fig_1\n\n::::\n\n::::{.cr-section layout=\"overlay-center\"}\nLet's take a look at what we found.\n::::\n\n::::{.cr-section layout=\"sidebar-left\"}\n:::{#cr-fig_2}\n\n![](index_files/figure-html/fig_2-1.png){width=672}\n\n:::\n\nCacao production in Peru has increased in recent years, with four regions -[**San Martín**]{style=\"color:#023743FF;\"}, [**Junín**]{style=\"color:#72874EFF;\"}, [**Huánuco**]{style=\"color:#476F84FF;\"}, and [**Ucayali**]{style=\"color:#FED789FF;\"}- accounting for 80% of the country's total production (134,000 tons). @cr-fig_2\n\nDespite this overall growth, [**Ucayali**]{style=\"color:#FED789FF;\"}, the third largest cacao-producing region, has experienced a production decline attributed to high temperatures, low rainfall, and significant pest and disease outbreaks, which negatively impact their [**efficiency**]{style=\"color:#F8766D;\"}. @cr-fig_2\n\n::::\n\n[**Efficiency**]{style=\"color:#F8766D;\"} represents the use of the minimum [inputs]{style=\"color:#F8766D;\"} to obtain an amount of [outputs]{style=\"color:#F8766D;\"}.\n\n[Inputs]{style=\"color:#F8766D;\"} are fundamental production factors such as labor, land, and trees, while [outputs]{style=\"color:#F8766D;\"} are the goods or services that are produced by combining inputs, in this case, the resulting cacao harvest.\n\n![](./pics/input_output.svg)\n\nThink of efficiency as how well a farmer can maximize the most out of their labor, land, and trees. It's about getting the biggest cacao harvest with the least amount of labor, land, and trees. \n\nSo, a more efficient farmer can produce more cacao using the same amount of inputs In other words, An efficient farmer can either:\n\n- Produce more cacao using the same resources.\n\n- Maintain the same production level with fewer resources.\n\n\\\n\\\n\n::::{.cr-section layout=\"overlay-center\"}\nEfficiency is relative and depends on who we compare it to.\n::::\n\n::::{.cr-section layout=\"sidebar-left\"}\n\n::: {#cr-fig_4_1}\n\n![](./pics/eff_model_4_1.svg)\n\n:::\n\nWe can represent the efficiency levels of cacao farmers as follows: \\\n\\\nEach [**dot**]{style=\"color:#81B29A;\"} represents a farmer. @cr-fig_4_1\n\n::: {#cr-fig_4_2}\n\n![](./pics/eff_model_4_2.svg)\n\n:::\n\nThe [**most efficient farmers**]{style=\"color:#E07A5F;\"} are on the right side of the graph and the [**least efficient farmers**]{style=\"color:#CFC16B;\"} are on the left side. @cr-fig_4_2\n\n::: {#cr-fig_4_3}\n\n![](./pics/eff_model_4_3.svg)\n\n:::\n\nFor example, a cacao farmer represented by the [**blue dot**]{style=\"color:#3D405B;\"} produces half as much as a farmer represented by the [**red dot**]{style=\"color:#E07A5F;\"} using the same amount of land, trees and labor. @cr-fig_4_3\n\n::: {#cr-fig_4_4}\n\n![](./pics/eff_model_4_4.svg)\n\n:::\n\nThe distribution of cacao farmers with respect to their levels of efficiency shows the following: \\\n\\\nMost cacao farmers in Ucayali show levels of inefficiency in their production. \\\n\\\nOn average, farmers can produce 3.1 times what they produce using the same amount of labor, land and cacao trees. @cr-fig_4_4\n\n3.5% of [**cacao farmers**]{style=\"color:#E07A5F;\"} use their labor, land and cacao trees efficiently, producing 1034 Kg of cacao per hectare, on average. @cr-fig_4_4\n\nWith the amount of labor, land and trees they currently use, 35% of farmers can produce [**twice**]{style=\"color:#3D405B;\"} as much, 33% of farmers can produce [**three times**]{style=\"color:#F2CC8F;\"} as much, and 16% can produce [**four times**]{style=\"color:#81B29A;\"} as much as they currently produce. @cr-fig_4_4\n\n::::\n\n::::{.cr-section layout=\"sidebar-left\"}\n:::{#cr-fig_3_1}\n\n![](./pics/fig_3_1.svg){width=80%}\n\n:::\n\nTo address problems in cacao production, farmers in [**Ucayali**]{style=\"color:#FED789FF;\"} have adopted agroecological practices. @cr-fig_3_1\n\n:::{#cr-fig_3_2}\n\n![](./pics/fig_3_2.svg){width=80%}\n\n:::\n\nFarmers predominantly implement agroecological practices with **short-term** effects such as [pest and disease management]{style=\"color:#F8766D;\"} and [weed management]{style=\"color:#F8766D;\"}. @cr-fig_3_2\n\nFarmers expressed needs for implementing those management practices mainly in improving crop health and yield maximization. These practices are crucial to mitigate economic losses caused by biotic factors that can significantly affect their production. @cr-fig_3_2\n\n::::\n\n::::{.cr-section layout=\"overlay-center\"}\nAre agroecological practices efficient in terms of resource use and cacao production?\n::::\n\n::::{.cr-section layout=\"sidebar-left\"}\n:::{#cr-fig_weed}\n\n![](./pics/weed.svg){width=80%}\n\n:::\n\nFarmers who implement mowing or weeding practices are less efficient in their production than farmers who do not implement these practices. @cr-fig_weed\n\n\n\n::::\n",
