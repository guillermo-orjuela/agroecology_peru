    "text": "This research provides evidence on the efficiency of agroecological practices implemented by cacao farmers in Peru’s Ucayali region.We conducted our study in 2024, examining 654 cacao producers using the “Agroecological practices characterization survey” of the CGIAR Initiative on Agroecology. Our main goal was to examine the efficiency of these farmers in terms of their available resources to produce cacao while implementing, or not, diverse agroecological practices\nTo make our findings accessible to different audiences, we have presented the results in two distinct formats:\nThe Storytelling Format:\nThis presentation style makes our scientific findings accessible to a general audience. We have structured the information in a narrative way, helping readers understand the connections between farming practices, efficiency, and agroecology practices. Through clear explanations and visual representations, we show how different agroecological practices are related to cacao production.\nThe Non-Technical Research Summary:\nThis format is specifically designed for decision makers who need clear, actionable information. We present key findings concisely and include specific policy recommendations based on our research. This summary helps policymakers understand the practical implications of our findings and how they might inform agricultural policy.\nEach format serves a unique purpose: the storytelling approach helps build understanding of the science behind agroecological practices, while the summary format guides policy decisions that could improve cacao farming practices in the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEfficiency of agroecological practices for cacao production in Peru\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuillermo Orjuela Ramirez\n\n\nDec 14, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon technical research summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuillermo Orjuela Ramirez\n\n\nDec 14, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "Cacao cultivation is a critical livelihood for approximately 90,000 farmers across the 16 regions in Peru. These farmers face significant challenges: maintaining production levels without expanding agricultural land, decoupling crops from deforestation, and addressing climate change impacts such as water scarcity, extreme weather events, and pest and diseases proliferation.\nTo address these challenges and maintain production levels, farmers use diverse agroecological practices.\nBut how efficient are these practices?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2023, we conducted a study in Ucayali (Provinces of Padre Abad and Coronel Portillo), the third largest cacao-producing region in Peru.\n\n\n\n\nThe study uses the “Agroecological practices characterization survey” of the CGIAR Initiative on Agroecology to assess the efficiency of agroecological practices in 654 cacao producers, in terms of resource use and output production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a look at what we found.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCacao production in Peru has increased in recent years, with four regions -San Martín, Junín, Huánuco, and Ucayali- accounting for 80% of the country’s total production (134,000 tons).\n\n\n\n\nDespite this overall growth, Ucayali, the third largest cacao-producing region, has experienced a production decline associated to high temperatures, low rainfall, and significant pest and disease outbreaks, which negatively impact their efficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEfficiency represents the achievement of maximum output with a given amount of inputs.\nInputs are fundamental production factors such as labor, land, and trees, while outputs are the goods or services that are produced by combining inputs, in this case, the resulting cacao harvest.\nInputsOutputsProductionprocessLandLaborTrees\nThink of efficiency as how well a farmer can maximize the most out of their labor, land, and trees. It’s about getting the biggest cacao harvest with the least amount of labor, land, and trees.\nSo, a more efficient farmer can produce more cacao using the same amount of inputs In other words, An efficient farmer can either:\n\nProduce more cacao using the same resources.\nMaintain the same production level with fewer resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEfficiency is relative and depends on who we compare it to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can represent the efficiency levels of cacao farmers as follows:\n\nEach dot represents a farmer.\n\n\n\n\nThe most efficient farmers are on the right side of the graph and the least efficient farmers are on the left side.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, a cacao farmer represented by the blue dot produces half as much as a farmer represented by the red dot using the same amount of land, trees and labor.\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution of cacao farmers with respect to their levels of efficiency shows the following:\n\n96.5% of cacao farmers in Ucayali showed levels of inefficiency in their production.\n\nOn average, farmers can produce 3.1 times what they produce using the same amount of labor, land and cacao trees.\n\n\n\n\n3.5% of cacao farmers use their labor, land and cacao trees efficiently, producing 1,034 Kg of cacao per hectare, on average.\n\n\n\n\nWith the same labor, land and trees they currently use, 35% of farmers can produce twice as much.\n\n33% of farmers can produce three times as much.\n\n16% can produce four times as much as they currently produce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo address problems in cacao production, farmers in Ucayali have adopted diverse agroecological practices.\n\n\n\n\nFarmers predominantly implement agroecological practices with short-term effects such as pest and disease management and weed management.\n\n\n\n\nFarmers expressed needs for implementing those management practices mainly in improving crop health and yield maximization.

In contrast, non-implementing farmers showed an inefficiency level of 2.8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFertility management\n\nFarmers who implementing organic fertilizers such as manure or guano demonstrate lower inefficiency levels than non-implementers.\n\nSpecifically, farmers implementing these practices showed an inefficiency level of 2.9, suggesting a favorable association between organic fertilizer application and production efficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWater management\n\nfarmers implementing tree-planting or vegetation conservation practices demonstrate higher efficiency levels compared to non-implementers.\n\nSpecifically, farmers adopting these practices showed an average inefficiency level of 2.8, indicating potential to increase their production by 2.8 times while maintaining current input levels."
